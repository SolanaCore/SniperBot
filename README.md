## First Principle Thinking — Experiment Log

## 📌 About This Project

This project is an **experiment in problem-solving** using **first principle thinking** — a method where you break down a large, complex challenge into its most basic elements and then rebuild a solution from the ground up.

Instead of following existing patterns or copying standard solutions, the focus here is on **understanding the root of the problem** and tackling it step-by-step in the simplest possible way.

## 🧠 What is First Principle Thinking?

First principle thinking is a mental model popularized by scientists and innovators. The core idea is:

> "Don’t reason by analogy. Break things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there."

### The Process

1. **Define the Problem Clearly**

   * Understand what you’re trying to achieve.
   * Strip away all assumptions.

2. **Break Down to Fundamentals**

   * Identify the absolute basics that cannot be simplified further.
   * Ask *why* repeatedly until you get to the core truths.

3. **Rebuild from the Ground Up**

   * Use the fundamentals as building blocks.
   * Design solutions without bias from existing methods.

4. **Test and Iterate**

   * Implement small, testable steps.
   * Learn from feedback and improve.

## 🔍 My Approach in This Experiment

* **Chunking the Challenge** — Treat the big goal as a set of small, independent problems.
* **Solving in Isolation** — Work on one chunk at a time without being distracted by the bigger picture.
* **Validating Each Step** — Test each solution before moving forward.
* **Iterative Improvement** — If something breaks, revisit the fundamentals and rebuild.

## 🎯 Why I’m Doing This

I want to test how effective first principle thinking is when applied to a large, complex problem. By documenting each small step, I aim to see:

* How much faster I can reach a functional result.
* How much I learn by deeply understanding each component.
* Whether this approach creates more innovative solutions.

## 📝 My Commitment

* **Experiment First** — No rushing to the final product.
* **Document the Process** — Record my thoughts, challenges, and learnings for each chunk.
* **Share the Results** — If the approach works well, I’ll share the full experience so others can benefit.

## 📅 Progress Updates

I will keep updating this README with links to detailed logs for each stage of the journey.

If you want, I can also make a **version with a progress-tracking table** so you can update it as you move forward.
Do you want me to prepare that version?
